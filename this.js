// Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

// 00:00 ðŸ”‘ JavaScript's "this" keyword can be confusing for many and behaves differently in various scenarios.
// 00:55 ðŸ”‘ The behavior of the "this" keyword depends on the context, such as whether it's in a function, global space, or an arrow function.
// 04:17 ðŸ”‘ In the global space, the value of "this" is the global object, which can vary depending on the JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., window in browsers, Global in Node.js).
console.log(this);
// 07:30 ðŸ”‘ Inside a function, the value of "this" can be undefined in strict mode or the global object in non-strict mode.
function x (){
    console.log(this);
}
x(); // window with non strict mode and undefined with strict mode
// 10:06 ðŸ”‘ JavaScript uses a mechanism called "this substitution," where "this" is replaced with the global object when it's undefined or null in non-strict mode.
// 16:11 ðŸ”‘ Inside an object's method, "this" refers to the object itself where the method is called.
const obj = {
    x : 'MSD',
    y : function (){
        console.log(this.x);
    }
}
obj.y(); //refere to obj itself output: MSD
// 21:11 ðŸ”‘ "call," "apply," and "bind" are important functions used to manipulate the value of "this" when calling methods and sharing them between objects.
// can be used to manipulate the this keyword 
const obj2 = {
    x : 'Dhoni',
}
obj.y.call(obj2); //Dhoni
// 26:23 ðŸ”‘ It's essential to understand "call," "apply," and "bind" to effectively control the value of "this" in JavaScript methods.
// 27:30 ðŸ”‘ In global space, the 'this' keyword refers to the global object (e.g., 'window' in the browser).
// 28:08 ðŸ”‘ In strict mode, 'this' inside a function is undefined; in non-strict mode, it refers to the global object.
// 35:23 ðŸ”‘ Understanding "this" substitution: When 'this' is undefined or null inside a function, it becomes the global object in non-strict mode only
// 39:59 ðŸ”‘ Inside an object's method, 'this' refers to the object itself.
// 44:12 ðŸ”‘ The 'call' method can be used to invoke a function with a specific 'this' context.
// 46:01 ðŸ”‘ Arrow functions do not have their own 'this' binding and take the value of the enclosing lexical context.
const obj3 = {
    x : 'MS DHONI',
    y : () => {
        console.log(this);
    }
}
obj3.y(); //window obj (arrow function don't have this binding this value will be enclosing lexical context)
// 48:46 ðŸ”‘ In the context of DOM elements, 'this' refers to the specific HTML element being interacted with.
// <button onclick="alert(this)">Click Me </button>
